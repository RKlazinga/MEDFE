# MEDFE
Full Reimplementation of "Rethinking Image Inpainting via a Mutual Encoder-Decoder with Feature Equalizations" by Liu et al.

**Please note** that this is not a working reimplementation! For a university project, we opted to re-implement the paper from scratch, without using the code as a guide. However, as you can read [here](https://github.com/RKlazinga/MEDFE/wiki/Reproduction-Blog), the paper itself does not contain enough details to properly implement the network.

In particular, the adversarial loss did not function properly over the course of the project.
